description = A large structural pylon designed to fit against fuselages and hull bodies, with an swept elliptical shape because that makes rockets look 20% cooler. Comes equipped with explosive bolts to separate in the event of fire, catastrophic failure, or pilot whim. Note that the warranty does not cover fire, catastrophic vehicle failure, or acts of Jebediah.
