title = Clamp-O-Tron 2i Docking Port

description = Invented after a peaceful protest against the lack of spacecraft attachment systems turned violent, the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port allows for the firm attachment of two separate vessels. After docking, vessels can be just as easily undocked. This version includes a small built-in Mk2 Illuminator, so you can see what you're about to crash into in the dark.
