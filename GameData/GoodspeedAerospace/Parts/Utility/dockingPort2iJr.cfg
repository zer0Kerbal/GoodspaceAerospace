title = Clamp-O-Tron 2i Jr.

description = Originally marketed as a child-size version of the normal Clamp-O-Tron, the Clamp-O-Tron Jr. soon found use among hobbyists and professional space agencies alike for its compact profile, lightweight structure, and all-round cuteness. As a result of its small size, it's usable for transferring resources, but not crew. This version includes a small built-in Mk2 Illuminator, so you can see what you're about to crash into in the dark.
