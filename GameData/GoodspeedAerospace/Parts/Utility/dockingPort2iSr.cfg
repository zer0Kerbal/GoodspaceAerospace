title = Clamp-O-Tron 2i Sr. Docking Port

description = The Clamp-O-Tron Sr. is the result of intense and costly development to answer the problem of how to make docking connections more sturdy. Thanks to the brilliant suggestion of the staff janitor "why don't you make 'em bigger?", the public now can enjoy the sheer thrill of docking enormous objects in space. This version includes a small built-in Mk2 Illuminator, so you can see what you're about to crash into in the dark.
