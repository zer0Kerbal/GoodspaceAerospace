<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE: 2014-04-01B</strong></p>
<p>If you downloaded 2014.4.1 earlier today (April 1st), be sure to
download 2014.4.1<strong>B</strong>, which fixes compatibility with the
ARM update (KSP 0.23.5) due to some texture renaming.</p>

<p>This parts pack add-on is an assortment of vaguely stock-alike parts,
most requiring no additional texture memory (they mostly have unique
models, but reuse stock part textures to save memory and achieve a
stock-alike look). I've been adding my own parts to the game for about a
year, filling in holes needing to be filled but either weren't filled by
other mods, or the other mods weren't stock-like, or required more
memory. For Kerbal Space Program.</p>
<p>This pack is an assortment of vaguely stock-alike parts, many
tweakable, most requiring no additional texture memory (they mostly have
unique models, but reuse stock part textures to save memory and achieve
a stock-alike look). I've been adding my own parts to the game for about
a year, filling in holes I thought needed to be filled but either
weren't filled by other mods, or the other mods weren't stock-like, or
required more memory than I wanted to use. The parts to be found in this
pack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seven command pods. When I started playing KSP, there were no 1.25m
and 2.5m probe cores, so I made some. Later, some were added, but the
torque was too small to be useful for rockets of that size, so I kept
using mine. Then they added reaction wheels, so in theory you could add
a stock core and a reaction wheel, but I kept using mine anyhow because
I'd grown attached to them. I also added a large space station hub and a
tiny radial attached probe core. For self-assembling space stations, I
created a docking port welded with control parts to minimize part
counts, and finally I adopted a rescue dog, err, part that had been
dropped from a previous version of KSP. Added 2014-04-01: the DSC-1 Deep
Space Capsule, a spherical command pod holding up to three kerbals, but
usable unmanned too.</li>
<li>Seven fuel tanks. I wanted some spherical tanks, and in multiple
sizes, but I didn't want to clutter up my VAB parts menu with a big list
of tanks in different sizes, so I developed tanks that only take one
icon on the VAB parts list, but can be placed and then five different
sizes chosen from (depends on the included GoodspeedTweakScale plugin).
Available in gold and orange. Also, nose caps that contain fuel and also
double as size adapters, vaguely Soyuzish side tanks, and a couple of
useful welded multitank parts. Added 2014-04-01: A large orange
"pill-shaped" tank.</li>
<li>A bipropellant RCS block. In real life, not all RCS uses
monopropellant, so I wanted a bipropellant option. This part is another
rescue part, adopted from an older version of KSP and repurposed.</li>
<li>Three hexagonal truss pieces for constructing deep space craft.</li>
<li>Two radial decouplers. Both allow side-mounting stuff, neither
leaves behind residue on the central tank, one uses a swept pylon design
because it looks cool.</li>
<li>Two radial attachment points. These are just resizes on the stock
1.25m part, one for 625mm parts, and one even smaller, meant to be used
the way you currently abuse cubic octagonal struts without requiring as
much space.</li>
<li>A nosecone designed to fit the stock large SRB and actually look
good.</li>
<li>Four power generators. A PB-NUK supplies a lot more power than I
really need most of the time, so I made the ZAP-01 RTG, a radial RTG
that only weighs 10kg (as opposed to the PB-NUK's 80kg), but is less
efficient (only 4.8/min). On the other hand, when dealing with things
like electric engines, an RTG simply cannot deliver enough power, for
that you use actual nuclear reactors, like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Affordable_Fission_Engine">SAFE-400</a>,
so I made three actual nuclear reactors, delivering 100kW, 200kW, or
400kW of power.</li>
<li>A larger Xenon tank, for using with those electric engines.
Eventually I made it resizable like the tanks above, so it's both larger
and smaller, depending on your needs.</li>
<li>Docking ports with lights! Actually, these are just standard docking
ports with standard lights welded on. Since I do this with every docking
port on my stations, and my stations usually have ridiculous numbers of
docking ports, this really helps reduce my part counts. But these parts
in particular are next on my list of things to replace with custom
models.</li>
<li>Test weights! I like to test and rate my subassemblies, so I can
just look at the weight of my payload and select the appropriate lifter,
so I wanted some nice test weights, but existing packs added too many
parts. With the addition of tweakables to the game, we can do better.
This pack has three weights, one for tenths of a ton, one for tons, and
one for tens of tons. Just grab the appropriate magnitude weight and
adjust the slider.</li>
<li>Rocket parts tank and warehouse. I used to use these with the
Orbital Construction mod, since it came with parts that were visually
identical to stock parts (and had absurd stats). I've since switched to
Extraplanetary Launchpads, but I keep using these parts as I like them
better than what EPL comes with. (Although with Baha making parts for
EPL now...)</li>
<li>Radial science storage container.</li>
<li>Orbital ore detector. The third and last of my "rescue parts", this
was an antenna in a previous version of KSP, which I repurposed to have
a usable ore detector (same stats as the larger kethane detector).</li>
