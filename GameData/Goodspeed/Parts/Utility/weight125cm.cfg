description = A container of dense matter marketed for use in test weights, because we couldn't find a better use for it.  This 1.25m diameter container weighs one ton, and can hold an additional ten tons of material. For your convenience while testing launch vehicles, it also contains a basic flight control computer and control moment gyroscopes.
